                <strong>Multi-Game Support:</strong> dIVa is expanding beyond Diablo IV!<br />
                With this upcoming update, the application will support multiple games, starting with <strong>Diablo II: Resurrected</strong>.<br />
                This enhancement allows players to track and optimize their gameplay experience across different games seamlessly.<br />
                <a href="../dIVa-d2r/index.html" class="text-accent underline">Check out the Diablo II: Resurrected Tutorial</a>

              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>New "Characters" Feature:</strong> The management of character aliases has been improved with a dedicated "Characters"
                feature.<br />
                This feature opens in its own window, providing a streamlined interface for managing your characters and updating character-specific
                data for each game more efficiently.<br />
                Now, you can also create new characters directly from this screen.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Leveling Overlay:</strong> Introducing the new "Leveling Overlay" feature, an in-game overlay that provides a quick summary of
                your current leveling milestones.<br />
                This overlay also includes controls for starting and stopping the leveling process, giving you a handy, in-game remote control for
                your leveling progress.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Offline Mode:</strong> A new "Offline Mode" feature has been introduced, allowing you to manage Characters and the Speed
                Leveling Tracker even when Overwolf game events are unavailable!<br />
                In the "Characters" screen, after adding a Character, it will automatically be marked as "offline." Previously, if the events were
                down, tracking your leveling progress wasn't possible.<br />
                Now, with Offline Mode, we've introduced the ability to manually complete milestones every 10 levels, providing a balanced solution
                that allows you to keep track of your progress without needing to click for every level.

                <strong>Menu Cleanup and Consolidation:</strong> The application menu has been streamlined and consolidated to better support the new
                "Characters" feature.<br />
                This update not only enhances the usability of the application but also aligns the menu design with the overall aesthetics of the
                application.
